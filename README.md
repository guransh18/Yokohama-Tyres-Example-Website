# Yokohama-Tyres-Example-Website
This is an example website created by me to showcase the front-end skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. It is a website for Yokohama Tyres.
It is responsive to all screen sizes. The design and elements were taken from a figma structure file.

Demo images of the website are available in Demo Files Folder
